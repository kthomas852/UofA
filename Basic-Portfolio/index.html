        <img height="180px" width="180px" src="assets/images/me.gif">
        <p>Starting from an early age I have been captivated with technology and 
            understanding the interworking's of the many complicated machines around me.  Out of 
            High School I had a Strong interest in digital design.  After dabbling 
            in graphic arts I graduated with a Bachelor's degree focused in Geography 
            and GIS from The University of New Mexico. 
            My first professional experience working the engineering space was as 
            an electrical engineering tech at Bladewerx, a research and development 
            company that specialized in radiation detection and spectroscopy. 
            The need to be in the dot com sphere and a love for local businesses 
            brought me to my current position at Yelp. My goal is to further my development and launch my career anew, working
            as a fullstack developer. </p>
