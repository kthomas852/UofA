Welcome to the Trivia Game
Built by Kyle Thomas 2018

This game uses questions stored in an object.  The goal of the game is get as many questions correct
as possible.  You are given 30 seconds to answer each individual question.  Get an answer wrong and
the game will let you know and move onto the next question.  If you take longer than 30 seconds to
answer a question the game will mark your guess as incorrect and move onto the next question.
Keep in mind that an answer will only be registered when you hit the submit button.

Have fun and good luck!
